<h1 align="center">Top Youtubers effecting GDP between 2019 - 2022??</h1>
    
    In today's world, the internet has become an integral part of our lives. With the rise of online platforms such as YouTube, it has become easier than ever for people to access information and entertainment from all over the world. At the same time, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remains one of the most widely used indicators of economic performance. In this project, we aim to explore the relationship between these two seemingly unrelated topics: GDP and YouTube. By analyzing data on GDP and YouTube usage patterns, we hope to gain insights into how these two factors are connected and what implications this may have on our understanding of the modern world.

The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between GDP and YouTube usage patterns. We will use data on GDP and YouTube usage patterns to gain insights into how these two factors are connected and what implications this may have on our understanding of the modern world.

Our goal is to answer the following questions:

- What are the the top Youtubers in countries around the globe?
- What is the Top GDP countries, and what is there growth during COVID?
- Is there a correlation between Top Youtubers and selected GDP Nations?
- What is statistical corelations can be made?

To answer these questions, we will use Python and its data analysis libraries, such as Pandas and Matplotlib. We will start by importing the dataset and cleaning the data, followed by exploratory data analysis and visualization.

I will be using the following datasets:

- [Top Youtubers](https://www.kaggle.com/mdhrumil/top-5000-youtube-channels-data-from-socialblade)
- [GDP](https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world)

APIs:

- [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/channels/list)
- [Google API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com)
